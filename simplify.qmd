An R-centric discussion of what to do to manage the complexity of mixed models, specifically their random effect components.

## setup

For this example we'll think about a forest restoration experiment with four plots; 5 restoration treatments that are applied in each plot (a randomized complete block design); and 6 replicates within each block/treatment.

## maximal model

## model reduction strategies

- set correlations to zero (`||`/`diag()`
   - caveat 1: using `||` for factor-valued terms in `lme4` won't work as expected; use `afex` or `glmmTMB` (or expand the factor in dummy variables)
   - caveat 2: results are sensitive to zero point (centering) of covariates
- drop terms
- reduced-rank models (`glmmTMB`)

## model constraint strategies

- priors to prevent singularity (Chung et al); `blme`, `glmmTMB`
- priors to regularize
